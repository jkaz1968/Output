# SHADOWS
A Traveller Adventure, v1.0b

Created with RPG Maker MV

If you're downloading this for the first time, there are a few things I need to tell you. First, this is based on previously published material, and as such is distributed free of charge. You may give it away but not sell it.

Many of you may not be familiar with RPG Maker games. They function basically the same as games like Pokemon, using a turn-based combat system and top-down view. Controls are pretty simple; you can use either the arrow keys, number pad (recommended) or mouse to move about the game field. 

Number pad:

7 (jump)  8 (up)  9 (n/a)

4 (left)  5 (n/a) 6 (right)

1 (n/a)   2 (dn)  3 (n/a)

Esc - opens the menu, mouse commands work here as well
Space - select an option

Left click - select
Right click - go back

That's basically it. This is my first attempt at publishing a game, so commentary is welcome.

Thank you to all who followed my progress and kept the encouragement flowing!

Jeff K, lead developer and pretty much everything else

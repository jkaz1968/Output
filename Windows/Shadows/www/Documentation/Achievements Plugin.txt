To set up achievements for your game, it's best to set up the achievements
right at the start of the game. Using the following plugin commands, we'll
create a few achievements.

1) - upp_setAchievementName id [Where id is the number. Start with 1 and
								   work your way up.]
2) - upp_setAchievementDesc id [This sets the description of the achievement.]
3) - upp_setAchievementLocation id [This sets the location of the achivement.]
4) - upp_setAchievementHidden id [This hides the achievement from the
									 achievement list.]
5) - upp_setAchievementComplete id [This marks the achievement complete. ]

It's best to use comments to separate the starting event that creates
your achievements.

You can also use the plugin command upp_openAchievementsViewer to open
the achievements directly.

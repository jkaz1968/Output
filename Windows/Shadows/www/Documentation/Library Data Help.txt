========================================

HOW TO USE:

CREATING A CATEGORY:
- In order to create a category, you have to set 3 required parameters, which are: [Category IDs], [Category Texts] and [Category Icons IDs]. Here is an example of these three parameters.

[Category IDs]:         primary, secondary
[Category Texts]:       Primary, Secondary
[Category Icons IDs]:   312, 311

- In the example above, the "primary" in [Category IDs] will be a category. The text that will be displayed when an entry is in this category is "Primary", and the default icon for this category is the ID "312".
- As I stated earlier, you can have as many categories as you want. You just need to separate the ids, names and icons with a comma (,).
	- If you are using a custom icon pack, you will want to refer to the icons for the desired number.
- IMPORTANT: Make sure that you have the same amount of ids, texts and icons. In other words, if you have 4 IDs, you must have 4 Texts and 4 Icons.


WRITING A LibraryData ENTRY:
- Open the database and go to the section "Common Events"
- Create a common event with the name "LibraryData" (without quotation marks)
- Create one or several comments to create Libraries.
- The comments need to follow a pattern:

{Example of LibraryData Entry|categoryID|iconID}
Description of the Entry.

- The "categoryID" is optional, but it is highly recommended in order to sort your Libraries. You can set as many categories as you want using the parameter [Category IDs]. If you don't specify the category of the entry, it will be set as "default".
- The "iconID" is also optional. You can put the ID of the icon you want to show for this entry. If you don't specify an icon, the entry will get the default icon for its category.
- You are allowed to have several comments meaning one entry (you don't need to use just the 6 lines for comments, you can add a new comment right below and keep going).
- You are allowed to write control characters in the description of the entry (such as \C[n], \I[n], \V[n]).
- You are allowed to use some special tags to get the name of an item, weapon, armor, enemy or actor. When you are writing the description of a entry, use the tags <enemy:ID>, <actor:ID>, <item:ID>, <weapon:ID> and <armor:ID> to print the name of the particular item on the description. Change "ID" for the corresponding number you want.
- There is a tag called [break-on-update]. When you use it, all the content of the same entry will be hidden, and it will just appear in the entry book when you call the plugin command "LibraryData update Title_of_the_entry".
- You are allowed to have as many [break-on-update] as you want. And always when you call the plugin command for updating, it will allow the player to see a new part of the entry.
(This is a good feature if you want to have a "step-by-step" entry, where each time the player completes the entry, the same entry is updated and new things have to be done).

REGISTERING A LibraryData ENTRY ON THE BOOK:
- To register an entry in the book, create an event in the map, go to "Plugin Command" and type the command for adding the entry
Ex.: LibraryData add Example of LibraryData Title
- To check the status or category of the entry, you can use these Script commands:

JKPlugins.LibraryData.isActive("Title of the Entry");
JKPlugins.LibraryData.is("Title of the Entry", "categoryID");

Notes:

"Example of Entry Title" does not need to be a single word or between quotation marks, it can be several words meaning one title.
